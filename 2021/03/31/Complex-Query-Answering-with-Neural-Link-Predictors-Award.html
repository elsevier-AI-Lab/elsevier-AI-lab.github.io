<meta name="description" content="Our paper “Complex Query Answering with Neural Link Predictors” has received an Outstanding Paper Award. Out of the 860 papers of the ICLR program, only 8 selected papers, that have been deemed of exceptional quality, have received this recognition! More information can be found in the official ICLR announcement. The actual paper can be found on openreview: https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Mos9F9kDwkz. Congratulations Daniel Daza and Michael Cochez, and also to our collaborators in this work, from the UCL Center of Artificial Intelligence, Erik Arakelyan and Pasquale Minervini! In this work, we show how to re-use models for 1-hop link prediction on knowledge graphs, to answer more complex queries involving larger sub-graphs. We improve upon previous methods that require orders of magnitude more training data. The paper will be presented virtually on May 6 in the Outstanding Paper conference session 00:00 - 01:00 PDT, 03:00 - 04:00 EDT, 09:00 - 10:00 CET, 15:00 - 16:00 CST." />
