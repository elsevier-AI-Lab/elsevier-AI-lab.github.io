&lt;h4 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BioBLP allows to investigate different ways of incorporating multimodal biomedical data for learning representations in KGs. With a particular implementation, we find that incorporating attribute data does not consistently outperform baselines, but improvements are obtained on a comparatively large subset of entities below a specific node-degree. Our results indicate a potential for improved performance in scientific discovery tasks where understudied areas of the KG would benefit from link prediction methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">After almost a year of extensive research, BioBLP is published!

&lt;p&gt;In his talk, Michael talked about several core themes of the lab: machine learning, knowledge representation, and scientific corpora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past decade, deep learning has taken a prominent role in the research landscape and some applications, often related to perception or generation, have become mainstream. Already before that, we have seen the uptake of technologies to represent complex interconnected information in the form of a knowledge graph.  In this talk, we will explore several ways in which this world of deep learning and the world of  rich semantic information interact with language. We will do this with the help of several research challenges, like query answering, incorporating labels into link prediction and inductive predictions, and scaling neural network training.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Michael Cochez, academic lab manager of the discovery lab was invited to give a keynote at the 3rd Workshop DL4LD: Addressing Deep Learning, Relation Extraction, and Linguistic Data</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">DiscoveryLab members win the LM-KBC competition!</title><link href="https://discoverylab.ai//2022/08/30/DiscoveryLab-members-win-LM-KBC-2022.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="DiscoveryLab members win the LM-KBC competition!" /><published>2022-08-30T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-08-30T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://discoverylab.ai//2022/08/30/DiscoveryLab%20members%20win%20LM-KBC-2022</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://discoverylab.ai//2022/08/30/DiscoveryLab-members-win-LM-KBC-2022.html">&lt;p&gt;Dimitrios Alivanistos and Michael Cochez of the Discovery Lab alongside a team of colleagues from the university win the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iswc2022.semanticweb.org/&quot;&gt;ISWC2022&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://lm-kbc.github.io/&quot;&gt;LM-KBC&lt;/a&gt; competition!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A diverse team of 6 colleagues from different labs: Dimitrios Alivanistos (DiscoveryLab), Selene Baéz Santamaría (CLTL, Hybrid Intelligence), Michael Cochez (DiscoveryLab), Jan-Christoph Kalo (DReaMS Lab), Emile van Krieken (L&amp;amp;R VU), Thiviyan Thanapalasingam (INDE Lab)
collaborated, participated and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;won&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Language Model for Knowledge Base Completion&lt;/em&gt; (LM-KBC) competition of ISWC2022!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team used OPENAI’s GPT-3 model, performed prompt engineering and gained insights on how large language model perform on KBC. Their approach uses few-shot prompting with only 4 examples, hand designed for each relation type.
One interesting finding: Simple triple-based prompts appear to work better than natural language prompts!&lt;/p&gt;

This time members of the lab will present StarQE: Query Answering on hyper-relational KG’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;StarQE: Query Embedding on Hyper-Relational KG’s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is the product of an international collaboration between Dimitrios Alivanistos (VU Amsterdam, DiscoveryLabs), 
Max Berrendorf (LMU Munich), Michael Galkin (Mila Quebec &amp;amp; McGill University) and Michael Cochez (VU Amsterdam, DiscoveryLabs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many papers in the literature that experiment with graph embeddings for answering queries over knowledge graphs. 
In their paper, members of the Discovery Lab, together with colleagues from Germany and Canada, have extended those algorithms to a richer family of graphs, called “hyper-relational graphs”.
These graphs allow for edges to be labelled with key-value pairs, instead of just a single label. 
This richer representation is gaining popularity as the go-to choice for public KG’s (WikiData) and in daily use in some
of the knowledge graphs constructed and maintained by Elsevier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first paper to explore query answering with the use of embeddings for such hyper-relational graphs. 
The authors also introduced a new hyper-relational query dataset - &lt;strong&gt;WD50K-QE&lt;/strong&gt; which they used for their experiments. 
They further analyse the impact of qualifier information in the performance of query answering systems and show a great 
boost when qualifiers are available!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SemEval (SEMantic EVALuations) is a highly-regarded conference where each year a number of tasks are proposed for some kind of semantic evaluation of text, images, or data. The tasks are challenges where different research groups develop competing systems. The task organizers provide training and testing data, as well as an evaluation procedure, for the different systems to use. After the end of the competition period, they write a paper on the task and on the results of the various competitors.
Corey proposed a task on extracting measurements and surrounding context from STM text. For example, in addition to spotting measurements like 273.6 MPa, additional information on the property being measured (e.g. fracture pressure), the entity being measured (concrete with a certain additive), and other special information on conditions (.e.g that the samples were cured at a temperature of -10 degrees C).  We expect this kind of additional information will allow us to merge measurements described in the running text with measurements provided databases or in tables in other articles. We think that will be very important as Elsevier continues to develop it data and analytics strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Corey Harper et. al. won the best task paper award at SemEval 2021!
