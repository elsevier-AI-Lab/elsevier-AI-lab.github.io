This time members of the lab will present StarQE: Query Answering on hyper-relational KG’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;StarQE: Query Embedding on Hyper-Relational KG’s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is the product of an international collaboration between Dimitrios Alivanistos (VU Amsterdam, DiscoveryLabs), 
Max Berrendorf (LMU Munich), Michael Galkin (Mila Quebec &amp;amp; McGill University) and Michael Cochez (VU Amsterdam, DiscoveryLabs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many papers in the literature that experiment with graph embeddings for answering queries over knowledge graphs. 
In their paper, members of the Discovery Lab, together with colleagues from Germany and Canada, have extended those algorithms to a richer family of graphs, called “hyper-relational graphs”.
These graphs allow for edges to be labelled with key-value pairs, instead of just a single label. 
This richer representation is gaining popularity as the go-to choice for public KG’s (WikiData) and in daily use in some
of the knowledge graphs constructed and maintained by Elsevier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first paper to explore query answering with the use of embeddings for such hyper-relational graphs. 
The authors also introduced a new hyper-relational query dataset - &lt;strong&gt;WD50K-QE&lt;/strong&gt; which they used for their experiments. 
They further analyse the impact of qualifier information in the performance of query answering systems and show a great 
boost when qualifiers are available!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge Graphs are a graph based abstraction to data that are broadly used to describe, integrate and extract value.
These Knowledge Graphs are at the heart of the discovery lab.
The book covers many topics:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Formalisms&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Schema, Identity, and Context&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SemEval (SEMantic EVALuations) is a highly-regarded conference where each year a number of tasks are proposed for some kind of semantic evaluation of text, images, or data. The tasks are challenges where different research groups develop competing systems. The task organizers provide training and testing data, as well as an evaluation procedure, for the different systems to use. After the end of the competition period, they write a paper on the task and on the results of the various competitors.
Corey proposed a task on extracting measurements and surrounding context from STM text. For example, in addition to spotting measurements like 273.6 MPa, additional information on the property being measured (e.g. fracture pressure), the entity being measured (concrete with a certain additive), and other special information on conditions (.e.g that the samples were cured at a temperature of -10 degrees C).  We expect this kind of additional information will allow us to merge measurements described in the running text with measurements provided databases or in tables in other articles. We think that will be very important as Elsevier continues to develop it data and analytics strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Corey Harper et. al. won the best task paper award at SemEval 2021!

He will be working on Reinforcement learning over structured multi-modal information &amp;amp; Bias in Recommendation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to joining the Discovery Lab, Masoud obtained his PhD from the Technical University of Eindhoven, the Netherlands.
During his PhD he worked intensively on recommender systems and in particular on discovery and reduction of bias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the lab he will work with multimodal information, and together with Herke van Hoof he will investigate its usage in a reinforcement setting.
When providing recommendations, it is often possible to get some evaluation of that recommendation (‘was it useful?’) while counterfactual information is often not available (‘would another recommendation have been more useful?’). These circumstances can make it difficult to train models using regression or classification techniques.
In the lab we investigate the use of reinforcement learning which can work with structured multi-modal information such as user context, knowledge graphs, or text  as inputs. As a result the system generates structured recommendations, such as proposals for promising looking lab experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">We are happy to announce that starting Masoud Mansoury is joing the Discovery Lab from July 2021 onwards.
